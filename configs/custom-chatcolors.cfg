//		Custom Chat Colors is written by Dr. McKay (http://www.doctormckay.com) (Updated for Chat-Processor)
//		Simple Chat Colors (Redux) is written by Antithasys
//		The configuration is very similar, so I've stolen Redux's documentation :P
//		
//		How to edit this file:
//		"admin_colors"										<--	Leave this alone
//		{																<--	Add all groups/steamids after first bracket (Leave this alone)
//																			
//			"STEAM_0:1:1234567"						<--	Here is a steamid example with a tag (don't duplicate steamids)
//			{
//				"namecolor"		"#RRGGBB"						<--	This is the color for the name (#RRGGBB in hex notation or #RRGGBBAA with alpha)
//				"textcolor"		"#RRGGBBAA"						<--	This is the color of the text
//			}
//
//			"groupname"											<--	This can either be a steamid for a specific player, or a group name
//			{															<--	Open the group
//				"flag"				"z"							<--	This is the flag(s) assoicated with the group.  This field doesn't matter if the group name is a steamid
//				"tag"				"[admin]"					<--	This is the text for the tag
//				"tagcolor"		"O"						<--	This is the color for the tag
//				"namecolor"		"G"						<--	This is the color for the name
//				"textcolor"		"T"						<--	This is the color of the text
//			}															<--	Close the group
//		}																<--	Add all groups/steamids before last bracket (Leave this alone)
//
//		NOTE:
//		If you don't enter a steamid then the group name does not matter, it's just for your reference.
//
//		For colors, either a hex notation of a color (#RRGGBB or #RRGGBBAA) or one of the supported shortcuts (O - Olive, G - Green, T - Team) is required
//
//		--------ORDER OF OPERATIONS--------
//		
//		The order in which you place items in the config file matters.  Here is what determins what color they get:
//		1. SteamID
//			If there is a steamid present, it will always override everything.  If you put a steamid in twice
//			then the first entry (top to bottom) will be used. (I think, just don't do it!)
//		2. Groups
//			The plugin will search (top to bottom) for a postitive match for the flag string.  The player' flags
//			will be compared with the group flag character (NOTE: only one flag per group! "a" is okay, "ab" is NOT),
//			and if the player has the flag, it will stop there.
//			For example. Admins with the "ad" flags and donators with the "a" flag.  If you place the "a" flag group
//			above the "d" group then the admin will get the "a" colors. Order matters.
//
//		---------DO NOT EDIT ABOVE THIS LINE---------
