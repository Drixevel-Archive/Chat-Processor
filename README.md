# Chat-Processor

A Sourcemod plugin which allows other plugins to add and manage chat related features.

üç¥ This is a fork of [Drixevel's Chat Processor](https://github.com/Drixevel-Archive/Chat-Processor) that uses MultiColors instead of ColorVariables. Use it you're having issues with the original.

## Installation

Place the .smx into the plugins folder and the .cfg into the configs folder.

## Usage

```C#
public Action CP_OnChatMessage(int& author, ArrayList recipients, char[] flagstring, char[] name, char[] message, bool& processcolors, bool& removecolors)
{
	Format(name, MAXLENGTH_NAME, "{red}%s", name);
	Format(message, MAXLENGTH_MESSAGE, "{blue}%s", message);
	return Plugin_Changed;
}
```
